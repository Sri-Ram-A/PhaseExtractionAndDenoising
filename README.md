I am attaching four research papers that provide important context for the work we are about to undertake on optical phase retrieval using advanced deep learning techniques. These papers cover topics like fringe analysis, phase extraction, and applications of deep learning in optical imaging systems.

## Objective
The aim is to understand and implement the following advanced tasks:

- *Denoising of wrapped phase maps using generative or transformer-based deep learning models.*

- *One-step phase extraction from noisy interferograms using transformer or diffusion models.*

- *Simultaneous extraction of phase and its spatial derivatives using diffusion models.*

Go through these papers, try to understand them, not in deep but at least you should get to know what they are doing

I have attached one more attachment to learn to go ahead with these topics, understand them.

Do these things in 2 to 3 days, we shall have online discussion on Wednesday, we will start the project. we can make group of 2 people and work on these.

 Kindly acknowledge if this works for you guys.
